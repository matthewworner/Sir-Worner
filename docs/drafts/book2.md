# BOOK TWO: "Wally Worner's Grandson and the Siege of Malta 1940-1943"

## 📖 Concept Overview
Nearly 400 years after Sir Wally Worner defended Stella during the Great Siege of 1565, his great-great-great grandson (also named Wally!) lives in the same house: **38 Triq il-Kurcifiss, Senglea**.

The year is 1940. Malta is about to face another siege—this time from the sky.
