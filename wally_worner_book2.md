## Prologue: The Attic Discovery

It was a hot summer day in June 1940 when twelve-year-old Wally Worner climbed into the dusty attic of Stella, his family's home at 38 Triq il-Kurcifiss in Senglea.

His grandmother had sent him up to look for old blankets. Instead, he found something extraordinary.

Behind a wooden chest, covered in centuries of dust, hung an ancient coat of arms. A yellow shield with a bold red stripe and six red roses. Above it, an armored arm. Around it, flowing red and yellow mantling. And at the top, words in Latin: *Non nobis tantum nati.*

"Grandmother!" Wally called down the stairs. "What is this?"

His grandmother climbed slowly up the ladder, her eyes growing wide when she saw what he'd found.

"Ah, Wally," she said softly. "That belonged to your ancestor. Another Wally Worner—Sir Wallace Worner. He was a Knight of St. John who fought in the Great Siege of Malta in 1565. He defended this very house, our Stella. Because of his bravery, the Grand Master Jean de la Valette himself gave him this house and named it 'Stella'—the Star."

Wally traced his fingers over the yellow and red shield. "What does the motto mean?"

"*Non nobis tantum nati*," his grandmother translated. "We are not born for ourselves alone. It means we live not just for ourselves, but to help others, to protect our community."

Outside, in the distance, came a sound that would change everything—the wail of air raid sirens.

"Grandmother, what's that noise?"

Her face went pale. "The war has come to Malta, Wally. Just like 375 years ago, our island is under siege again."

## Chapter One: The First Bombs Fall

**June 11, 1940**

Wally had heard about the war in Europe. France was falling. Britain stood alone. But Malta was so small, so far away—surely the war wouldn't come here?

He was wrong.

That morning, Italian bombers appeared over Grand Harbour. Wally stood on the roof of Stella with his father, watching as three tiny biplanes rose to meet them—Malta's entire air defense.

"Faith, Hope, and Charity," his father said, pointing at the three Gloster Gladiators. "That's what they're calling our fighters. Three old planes against the entire Italian air force."

The dogfight was brief but fierce. The little Gladiators darted between the Italian bombers like angry wasps. Bombs fell into the harbor, sending up huge fountains of water.

"Papa, will they bomb Senglea?"

His father put his hand on Wally's shoulder. "They might, son. Senglea has always been important because of the harbors. That's why the first Wally Worner defended it in 1565. And if they do bomb us, we'll defend it again."

That night, Wally couldn't sleep. He went back to the attic and looked at the ancient coat of arms by candlelight.

"I'm named after you," he whispered to the painted shield. "If you could defend Stella with a sword, I can defend it now. Somehow."

The roses on the yellow shield seemed to glow in the candlelight, as if the first Wally was answering: *You can. You will. Non nobis tantum nati.*

## Chapter Two: Life Under Siege - Meeting Laurence

As summer turned to autumn, the bombing intensified. German aircraft joined the Italians—sleek Messerschmitt fighters and terrifying Junkers Ju-87 Stukas with their screaming sirens.

The Italians came in large formations, but they often missed their targets. Wally and his friends would watch the Italian bombers drop their loads into the empty sea.

"They couldn't hit the side of Fort St. Angelo from inside it!" his friend Mario joked.

But the Germans were different. When the Stukas dove, their sirens wailing like banshees, people ran for the shelters. The Germans were precise, deadly, efficient.

Senglea carved deep shelters into the limestone rock beneath the streets. Families would spend entire nights underground while bombs shook dust from the ceiling.

On his first night in the shelter, Wally met a boy his own age sitting against the wall, looking scared and hungry.

"I'm Wally," he said, sitting down next to the boy. "Wally Worner. I live at number 38 Triq il-Kurcifiss."

"Laurence," the boy replied quietly. "Laurence Mizzi. My family lives near the docks. We see everything from our house—every raid, every bomb."

The two boys became fast friends. They were both twelve, both living through something no child should experience. They shared what little food they had, told each other stories, and tried to be brave together.

"I think I suffer more from hunger than from bombs," Laurence confided one night after a particularly long raid.

Wally pulled out a small piece of bread his grandmother had given him and broke it in half. "Here. We share everything. That's what friends do."

Laurence smiled. "That's what *Maltese* do."

Wally's family brought what they could into the shelter: blankets, a little food, water, and—at Wally's insistence—a small photograph of the family coat of arms.

"The first Wally is with us," he told his little sister Maria and Laurence. "He'll keep us safe."

Food became scarce. The Royal Navy tried to send convoys, but German U-boats and Italian warships sank many supply ships. Ration cards limited each person to tiny amounts of bread, oil, and meat.

Wally's grandmother, ever resourceful, kept rabbits in a hutch behind Stella. "Just like in the old days," she said. "Malta has always survived on rabbit stew and determination."

One night, she made her famous stuffat tal-fenek with their last rabbit, onions from the garden, and precious wine she'd been saving. She invited Laurence's family to share it.

"This is what the old woman gave the first Wally before the great battle of 1565," grandmother said, ladling the rich stew into bowls. "If it gave him strength then, it will give us strength now."

Laurence took a small bite and savored it. "It's the best thing I've eaten in months, Mrs. Worner."

"Then you'll always have a place at our table, Laurence," she replied warmly.

## Chapter Three: Heroes of Malta

One particularly long night in the shelter, with bombs falling steadily above, Wally's grandmother gathered the children around her.

"Let me tell you about some heroes of Malta," she said, her voice cutting through the fear. "Not all heroes carry guns or fly planes."

**Mary Ellul - "Mary the Man"**

"There's a woman named Mary Ellul. Have you seen her, Wally? Laurence?"

Both boys nodded. Everyone knew Mary.

"They call her 'Mary the Man' because she's stronger than most men I know. She's Malta's only female Air Raid Warden. After every bombing, when the dust settles, Mary goes into the rubble with her bare hands and pulls people out. White hair, always in her uniform, absolutely fearless."

"I saw her last week," Laurence said quietly. "After the bomb hit near the church. She lifted a beam that three men couldn't move. Saved a whole family."

Wally thought about that. A woman stronger than men, saving lives every day.

**Mabel Strickland - The Unstoppable Editor**

"Then there's Miss Mabel Strickland," grandmother continued. "She runs The Times of Malta newspaper. The German and Italian bombers have hit her building twice—TWICE!—but she refuses to stop. You know what she did?"

"What?" Maria asked, wide-eyed.

"She moved the whole newspaper operation into a cave beneath Valletta. Every single day, no matter how heavy the bombing, The Times of Malta comes out. People need news. They need to know what's happening. They need hope. And Miss Strickland gives it to them."

Wally made a mental note to look for the newspaper tomorrow. He hadn't realized how brave it was just to print the truth every day.

**Henrietta "Chetta" Chevalier - "Mrs. M"**

"And there's a Maltese lady far away in Rome," grandmother said, her voice dropping to almost a whisper. "Mrs. Henrietta Chevalier. Her husband died just before the war started, leaving her with eight children—eight! When war broke out, she couldn't get back to Malta. She's trapped in Rome."

"That's terrible," Laurence said.

"Ah, but listen to what she's doing," grandmother continued. "She could hide. She could keep her head down and protect only her own children. But instead, she's hiding Allied soldiers and Jewish refugees in her tiny apartment. Dozens of them have passed through her home. She feeds them, shelters them, helps them escape. The Fascists are everywhere, but she doesn't stop. They call her 'Mrs. M' in the underground."

"But what if they catch her?" Wally asked, horrified. "What happens to her children?"

"That's what makes her a hero, Wally. She knows the risk. She does it anyway. Four thousand people—FOUR THOUSAND—she and her friends have helped save."

**The Lesson**

Wally thought about his ancestor, the first Wally Worner. Then he thought about these three women—Mary with her strength, Mabel with her words, Henrietta with her courage.

"Grandmother, our family motto—'Non nobis tantum nati'—that's what they're all doing, isn't it? Not born for themselves alone."

She smiled through the dust and darkness. "Exactly, my boy. Mary saves strangers from rubble. Mabel tells the truth even when bombs fall. Henrietta risks everything for refugees she's never met. That's what makes a hero—not just soldiers with guns, but nurses, journalists, air raid wardens, mothers. All of them living for something bigger than themselves."

Laurence looked at Wally. "Like sharing your last piece of bread with a friend?"

"Like that," grandmother nodded. "Exactly like that."

Above them, the bombs continued to fall. But down in the shelter, surrounded by neighbors and friends, Wally felt something stronger than fear.

Hope.

## Chapter Four: The Falcon Arrives

**April 1942**

Wally had become an official plane spotter, stationed on Stella's roof with binoculars and an identification chart. Laurence often joined him, and together they'd learned to tell a Stuka from a Macchi, a Me-109 from a Hurricane.

But on one April morning, they saw something that made both boys' hearts leap.

"Papa! Laurence, look!" Wally shouted.

From the north, flying low and fast, came dozens of aircraft—but these weren't bombers. They were sleek, elegant fighters with elliptical wings.

"Spitfires!" his father shouted from below. "The Spitfires have arrived!"

Forty-seven brand-new Spitfire Mk Vs roared overhead, fresh from the aircraft carrier USS Wasp. Wally and Laurence watched them land at Ta' Qali and Luqa airfields. 

"Look how fast they're working!" Laurence pointed.

Within minutes—literally minutes—ground crews were refueling and rearming them. The Germans, who had learned the Spitfires were coming, launched an immediate raid to destroy them on the ground.

But they were too late. Within fifteen minutes, the Spitfires were back in the air.

What followed was the greatest air battle Wally and Laurence had ever seen. The new Spitfires tore into the German formations. Me-109s that had ruled Malta's skies for months suddenly found themselves outmatched.

**Meeting Buzz Beurling**

A few weeks later, Wally was on his usual spotting duty when he saw a pilot walking near the Ta' Qali airfield. The man had a cocky grin and confident stride.

"You the kid who spots planes?" the pilot asked in an accent Wally didn't recognize.

"Yes, sir! I'm Wally Worner, official plane spotter."

"George Beurling. But everyone calls me Buzz. I'm from Canada." He looked at Wally's binoculars. "You any good?"

"The best in Senglea!" Laurence piped up, appearing from around the corner.

Buzz laughed. "Well, you spot 'em, kid, and I'll shoot 'em down. Deal?"

Over the next weeks, Wally and Laurence watched in awe as Buzz Beurling became a legend. In just fourteen days, he shot down 27 enemy aircraft. Twenty-seven!

The Maltese people started calling him "The Falcon of Malta."

One evening, Buzz found Wally on Stella's roof. "You did good spotting today, kid. That early warning gave us the altitude advantage."

"Really?" Wally beamed.

"Really. Every job matters, Wally. You're up here with your binoculars, the ground crew keeps my Spitfire flying, the people in the shelters keep hoping. We all defend Malta together."

It was exactly what grandmother had said. *Non nobis tantum nati.* Not born for ourselves alone. Everyone had a role. Everyone mattered.

## Chapter Five: Stella Under Fire

**May 1942**

The Germans were furious about the Spitfires. They intensified their attacks on the dockyard areas—which meant Senglea was in the crosshairs.

On a bright May morning, Wally was helping his grandmother in the garden when the sirens wailed. They ran for the shelter, but Wally looked back just in time to see a formation of Stukas diving toward Triq il-Kurcifiss.

The scream of the dive bombers was terrifying—a sound designed to break morale. Explosions rocked the street. The blast wave threw Wally to the ground.

When the dust cleared, he looked up in horror.

Stella had been hit.

Not a direct hit—the bomb had landed in the street—but the blast had blown out windows, collapsed part of the roof, and torn chunks of limestone from the walls.

Wally scrambled through the rubble, tears streaming down his face. "No, no, no... not Stella..."

His father pulled him back. "It's okay, son. The walls are still standing. Look—the house is damaged, but it's still here. Stella is still here."

Laurence appeared, covered in dust from his own house nearby. "Wally! Are you okay?"

"Stella's hurt," Wally said, his voice breaking.

Mary Ellul arrived within minutes, her white hair visible through the smoke. "Anyone trapped?" she called out in her strong voice.

"No, Mary, we're all safe," Wally's father replied. "But the house..."

Mary looked at the damaged facade of number 38 and put her strong hand on Wally's shoulder. "Your family has lived here since 1565, yes? The first Wally Worner defended this house?"

Wally nodded.

"Then these walls have stood through worse. We'll repair it. Malta always repairs. That's what we do."

That night, by candlelight in the shelter, Wally's grandmother told the story again—of how the first Wally Worner had defended this house during the Great Siege of 1565. How cannons had fired from its windows. How it had stood like a star of hope.

"Stella has survived two sieges now," she said. "It will survive this one too. Because Worners don't give up. And neither do Maltese."

The next morning, despite the danger, Wally helped his father shore up the damaged walls with timber and stones. Neighbors came to help. Laurence's father brought extra wood. Others brought tools.

An older Maltese man appeared with his carpenter's toolbox. He had kind eyes and skilled hands.

"I'm Salvo," he said warmly. "I heard Stella was hurt. This house is special—it survived 1565, it will survive 1942. But it needs proper repairs. Let me help with the window frames."

Wally watched in amazement as Salvo carefully measured, cut, and fitted new timber frames for the blown-out windows. His hands moved with precision and care, treating each piece of wood like it was precious.

"You're really good at this, Mr. Salvo," Wally said admiringly.

"When you fix something broken," Salvo replied, setting a frame perfectly into place, "you don't just repair it. You show it respect. Stella has stood for nearly 400 years. She deserves the best craftsmanship."

By evening, with Salvo's expert woodwork and everyone's help, Stella's windows had beautiful new timber frames. They weren't just functional—they were works of art.

"The first Wally defended this house with sword and cannon," young Wally said, hammering a board into place. "I'll defend it with hammer and nails. *Non nobis tantum nati.*"

"And I'll defend it with good timber and honest craftsmanship," Salvo added with a smile.

Laurence worked beside them both. "We'll defend it together."

## Chapter Six: Operation Pedestal

**August 1942**

By summer, Malta was starving. Fuel was almost gone. Food was running out. If a convoy didn't get through soon, the island would have to surrender.

Wally had grown thinner. So had Laurence. So had everyone. The hunger was constant now, a hollow ache that never went away.

"I told you," Laurence said weakly one day. "I suffer more from hunger than from bombs."

Britain launched Operation Pedestal—fourteen merchant ships and a massive naval escort. Their mission: break through to Malta at all costs.

The Germans and Italians threw everything at the convoy. Submarines, bombers, torpedo boats, and mines. Ship after ship went down.

On August 13th, Wally stood on the battered roof of Stella, scanning the horizon with his binoculars. His hands shook—not from fear, but from hunger. He'd eaten only a thin slice of bread that day.

Laurence climbed up beside him. "See anything?"

"Not yet. The convoy should be close..."

"There!" someone shouted from a nearby roof. "A ship!"

Through the morning haze, limping into Grand Harbour, came the tanker SS Ohio. She'd been bombed, torpedoed, and nearly sunk. Her deck was awash. Her engines were dead. Two destroyers lashed to her sides were literally pushing her forward.

But she was still afloat. And her tanks were full of precious fuel.

The entire harbor erupted in cheers. Church bells rang. People wept openly. Wally and Laurence hugged each other, jumping up and down on Stella's roof.

"We made it!" Laurence shouted. "We're going to survive!"

Only five of the fourteen merchant ships made it through, but they brought enough supplies to keep Malta fighting.

That night, Wally's family shared a small feast—real bread, tinned meat from the convoy, and even a little chocolate. They invited Laurence's family to join them.

Grandmother raised her glass of water (wine was long gone).

"To Wally Worner—the first one who defended us in 1565, and this one, who's helping defend us now. To Laurence Mizzi and all the brave children of Malta. To Mary Ellul, Mabel Strickland, and Henrietta Chevalier. To Buzz Beurling and all the pilots. To everyone who refused to give up."

She paused, looking at each face around the table.

"*Non nobis tantum nati.* To all of us."

## Chapter Seven: The Tide Turns

**Late 1942**

The Spitfires had changed everything. Malta, which had been desperately defending itself, became a base for striking back.

Bombers and torpedo planes flying from Malta's airfields began sinking Axis supply ships heading to North Africa. Rommel's Afrika Korps, which had nearly reached Egypt, started running out of fuel and supplies.

From Stella's roof, Wally and Laurence watched Allied bombers take off at dusk, heading for enemy convoys.

"We're not just surviving anymore," Laurence said. "We're winning."

The Luftwaffe still came, but less frequently. The Italian bombers came less and less—their losses had been too heavy, and many of their aircraft mysteriously developed "mechanical problems" before reaching Malta.

Buzz Beurling was promoted and decorated. Before he left Malta, he found Wally one last time.

"Keep watching the skies, kid. And remember—it wasn't just us pilots who won this. It was the spotters, the ground crews, the people who didn't give up. It was kids like you and your friend Laurence who stayed strong."

By November 1942, Operation Stoneage succeeded where so many convoys had failed—four merchant ships arrived safely with food, fuel, and ammunition.

The siege was effectively over.

Malta had survived.

---

## Chapter Eight: Stella Still Shines

**1943**

The bombing raids became rare, then stopped altogether. The Germans and Italians withdrew their forces. The Allies invaded Sicily, then Italy itself.

Malta had won.

Wally and his father began the long work of properly repairing Stella. Neighbors helped—just as they had helped others rebuild. Laurence's family worked alongside them. The community that had sheltered together, starved together, and survived together now rebuilt together.

Mary Ellul stopped by to help, lifting beams that grown men struggled with. "Stella looks good," she said approvingly. "Strong walls. Like the people who live in it."

Salvo returned too, bringing more beautiful timber. "Now that the bombing has stopped, we can do this properly," he said. "Stella deserves the finest window frames in all Senglea."

Over the following weeks, Salvo worked his magic on Stella. Each window frame was crafted with care and precision. When he finished, Wally's father tried to pay him, but Salvo refused.

"No, no," Salvo said firmly. "This house stood through two sieges. It protected families. It's an honor to help restore it. This is my way of saying *Non nobis tantum nati.*"

Wally understood. Salvo was living the motto too—using his skills not just for money, but to help his community, to preserve something important, to pass on beauty to the next generation.

"Thank you, Mr. Salvo," Wally said. "Stella is beautiful again because of you."

Salvo put his hand on Wally's shoulder. "No, Wally. Stella is beautiful because of everyone—you who watched for planes, Laurence who shared your struggles, Mary who rescued people, your grandmother who kept hope alive, and yes, me with my timber. We all did our part. That's what Malta does. That's what 'not born for ourselves alone' means."

One evening, as the sun set over Grand Harbour, Wally's grandmother brought out the old coat of arms from the attic. She hung it back on the wall of Stella's main room—the wall that had stood through two sieges.

"Two Wally Worners," she said. "Two sieges. One house. Same values."

Wally looked at the yellow shield with its red stripe and six roses. He thought about his ancestor, Sir Wallace Worner, standing in this very house in 1565, watching Ottoman ships in the harbor. He thought about the battles they'd both fought—375 years apart but somehow the same.

"What happened to the first Wally?" young Wally asked. "After the siege?"

"He lived here," grandmother said. "In Stella. He raised a family. He gathered people together—knights and common folk. He lived his motto: *Non nobis tantum nati.* Not born for ourselves alone."

"That's what we did too," Wally realized. "In the shelters. Sharing food with Laurence. Helping each other rebuild. Mary saving people. Miss Strickland printing the truth. Mrs. Chevalier hiding refugees. Buzz Beurling and the pilots. All of us."

Laurence, who had come over for dinner (as he did most nights now), nodded. "Living for each other."

Grandmother smiled. "That's what Worners do. That's what Maltese do. That's what heroes do—not just the ones with swords and Spitfires, but the ones who help their neighbors, share their last piece of bread, and refuse to give up."

She pointed to the coat of arms. "See those six roses? I think each one represents something: courage, loyalty, community, sacrifice, hope, and love. The first Wally lived by those values. You did too. All of you did."

"And the red stripe?" Wally asked.

"That," she said, "is the path we walk—sometimes difficult, often steep, but always leading forward. Both Wallys walked that path. Both defended not just this house, but what it represents."

That night, Wally and Laurence stood on Stella's newly repaired roof and looked out at Grand Harbour. The ships were peaceful now. The stars were bright—no searchlights, no tracers, no fires.

"You know what?" Laurence said. "When I have children someday, I'm going to tell them about you. About your family. About Stella."

"And I'll tell mine about you," Wally replied. "About the friend who shared the worst days of his life with me. About all the heroes—Mary, Mabel, Mrs. Chevalier, Buzz. About how Malta refused to surrender."

They could see, in their minds, the first Wally Worner standing here in 1565, watching for Ottoman ships. And they knew, somehow, that their ancestor could see them too.

Two guardians. Two sieges. Four centuries apart.

But the same house. The same values. The same unbreakable spirit.

Stella—the Star—still shone.

## Epilogue: The Legacy Continues

Years later, when Wally Worner was an old man, his own grandson came to visit Stella—which still stood at 38 Triq il-Kurcifiss. Laurence Mizzi, now elderly himself, was there too, still Wally's best friend after all these years.

The grandson ran his hand along one of the beautiful timber window frames—still strong, still perfect after all these decades.

"These are beautiful, Grandfather. Who made them?"

"A master craftsman named Salvo," old Wally said with a warm smile. "During the war, after Stella was damaged by bombs, Salvo came and made these window frames. He refused payment. He said it was an honor to help restore a house that had survived two sieges."

"Salvo understood something important," Laurence added. "That his skills were a gift meant to be shared. Those window frames aren't just wood—they're an act of love for Malta, for community, for history."

"Grandfather," the boy asked, "were you really a hero?"

Old Wally took down the coat of arms—the same one that had hung there since 1565. The same one he'd carried in his heart during the bombing raids.

"Do you know what this motto means?" he asked. "*Non nobis tantum nati.* We are not born for ourselves alone."

"It means," old Wally continued, "that real heroism isn't about being the strongest or the bravest. It's about helping others."

Laurence added, "It's about sharing your last piece of bread with a friend. About refusing to give up when others depend on you."

"It's about defending not just your house," Wally said, "but your community, your values, your family. It's about people like Mary Ellul pulling strangers from rubble. Mabel Strickland printing the truth. Henrietta Chevalier hiding refugees. It's about ordinary people doing extraordinary things."

"Two Wally Worners defended this house," he continued. "One with a sword in 1565. One with courage in 1942. Both lived this motto. Both understood that we're all connected—that when we help each other, we're all stronger."

"And you know what? Someday, you might face your own siege. Not with bombs or swords, but with challenges, difficulties, choices. When that day comes, remember this motto. Remember Stella. Remember that Worners don't give up. We help each other. We protect each other."

The boy looked at the yellow shield with its red stripe and six roses, and he understood.

The legacy wasn't about battles or sieges.

It was about values that endure.

It was about a star that keeps shining.

## Historical Note

The Siege of Malta (1940-1943) really happened. Malta suffered over 3,340 air raids—more than London during the Blitz. The island was awarded the George Cross for collective bravery on April 15, 1942—the only time an entire population has received this honor.

**The heroes in this story were real:**

- **George "Buzz" Beurling** - Canadian ace who shot down 27+ aircraft over Malta, earning the nickname "The Falcon of Malta"
- **Laurence Mizzi** - A real Maltese boy who lived through the siege and famously said he "suffered more from hunger than from bombs"
- **Mary Ellul** - Malta's only female Air Raid Warden, known as "Mary the Man" for her incredible strength in rescuing people from bombed buildings
- **Mabel Strickland** - Editor of The Times of Malta, which never missed an issue despite being bombed twice, operating from a cave when necessary
- **Henrietta "Chetta" Chevalier** - Maltese widow in Rome who helped save 4,000 people through the Rome Escape Line, known as "Mrs. M"

Operation Pedestal (August 1942) and the heroic journey of the tanker SS Ohio are true. Only five of fourteen merchant ships made it through, but they saved Malta.

While young Wally Worner is fictional, his story represents the real experiences of Maltese families who endured the siege. Many families lived in the same houses their ancestors had defended in 1565—including homes in Senglea that stood through both sieges.

The values of courage, community, and mutual support that sustained Malta through both sieges are real. *Non nobis tantum nati*—not born for ourselves alone—is not just a motto. It's how Malta survived.

And Stella, at 38 Triq il-Kurcifiss in Senglea, stands today—a reminder that some stars never stop shining.
